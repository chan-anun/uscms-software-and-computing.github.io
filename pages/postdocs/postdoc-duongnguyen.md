    This project aims to optimize tape access for various use cases, particularly in data reprocessing workflows. Typical examples include ReReco campaigns, where RAW data needs to be staged, and ReMINIAOD, which requires staging of AOD data. By analyzing current tape access patterns, the project seeks to enhance the quality of service for tape-based data access within the collaboration. Additionally, the project will prototype a production workflow using the "carousel" model, where a sliding buffer of tape data is staged to disk for processing and automatically removes it once processing is complete. The impact of this approach on CMS data production and reprocessing will be assessed, focusing on improving storage efficiency and reducing overall storage costs for the collaboration.
