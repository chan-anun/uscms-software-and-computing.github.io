project_title: CMS Data Management Operations
project_goal: >
  With a B.S. in Physics Cum Laude from Universidad de los Andes and a specialization in Data Analysis from University of Michigan, I possess a strong foundation in scientific problem-solving.
  In the past, I've worked as Senior Researcher in the data analytics consulting sector which involved conceptualizing and developing applied mathematics and machine learning projects, significantly
  improving operational efficiency for clients in various sectors. I've also worked for a startup in the tech sector where I I streamlined data annotation processes using Python and bash scripting,
  directly enhancing machine learning model performance. I am eager to contribute to the fascinating world of CMS where I hope to learn from the world's top scientific computing experts and help advance the ever growing field of particle physics.

  The data management team aims to ensure the efficient, reliable, and scalable management of the massive scientific data generated by the experiment, enabling physicists around the world to conduct their research.

  This goal can be further broken down into the following sub-goals:

  - Efficient data acquisition and storage:
    - Develop and operate robust data management systems to handle the ever-growing volume of data generated by the experiment.
    - Optimize data transfer policies to minimize transfer time and errors.
  - Reliable data access and preservation:
    - Guarantee the integrity and accessibility for authorized users across the globe.
    - Implement robust data policies for disaster recovery and backup strategies to ensure data availability in case of unforeseen events.
  - Scalability and adaptability:
    - Continuously evolve the data management infrastructure to accommodate the increasing data volume and complexity of future CMS runs.
    - Adapt to advancements in computing technologies and integrate with new data analysis tools.
  - User support and collaboration:
    - Provide efficient and responsive support to physicists and researchers accessing and analyzing CMS data.
    - Collaborate with international partners and other experiments to share best practices and develop common data management solutions.
